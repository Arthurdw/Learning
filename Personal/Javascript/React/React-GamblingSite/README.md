<!-- Description -->
A basic gambling site to learn the basics of React.  
This was my first react website and an intoduction to React!  
Since GitHub has problems with running react-router I'll post some screenshots under this.  
I learned the basics of components via the homepage.

I learned how classes and their constructors behave in React via the spinning page.

I learned about the router dom in react via the 404 page. (auto reconnect)
